Unofficial scripts for installing [Pyrodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pyrodactyl-oss/pyrodactyl) & [Elytra](https://github.com/pyrohost/elytra) (the daemon). Works with the latest version of Pyrodactyl!

This project is a fork of [pterodactyl-installer](https://github.com/pterodactyl-installer/pterodactyl-installer) by Vilhelm Prytz, adapted to install Pyrodactyl Panel and the Elytra daemon. It is not associated with the official Pyrodactyl or Pterodactyl projects.

## Features

- Automatic installation of the Pyrodactyl Panel (dependencies, database, cronjob, nginx).
- Automatic installation of Elytra (Docker, systemd).
- Panel: (optional) automatic configuration of Let's Encrypt.
- Panel: (optional) automatic configuration of firewall.
- Uninstallation support for both panel and Elytra.

## Supported installations

List of supported installation setups for panel and Elytra (installations supported by this installation script).

_\* Indicates an operating system and release that previously was supported by this script._

## Using the installation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to install just the panel, just Elytra or both.

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Muspelheim-Hosting/pterodactyl-installer/master/install.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._

## Firewall setup

The installation scripts can install and configure a firewall for you. The script will ask whether you want this or not. It is highly recommended to opt-in for the automatic firewall setup.

## Development & Ops

### Testing the script locally

To test the script, we use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). With Vagrant, you can quickly get a fresh machine up and running to test the script.

If you want to test the script on all supported installations in one go, just run the following.

```bash
vagrant up
```

If you only want to test a specific distribution, you can run the following.

```bash
vagrant up <name>
```

Replace name with one of the following (supported installations).

- `ubuntu_jammy`
- `debian_bullseye`
- `debian_buster`
- `debian_bookworm`
- `debian_trixie`
- `almalinux_8`
- `almalinux_9`
- `rockylinux_8`
- `rockylinux_9`

Then you can use `vagrant ssh <name of machine>` to SSH into the box. The project directory will be mounted in `/vagrant` so you can quickly modify the script locally and then test the changes by running the script from `/vagrant/installers/panel.sh` and `/vagrant/installers/wings.sh` respectively.

### Creating a release

In `install.sh` github source and script release variables should change every release. Firstly, update the `CHANGELOG.md` so that the release date and release tag are both displayed. No changes should be made to the changelog points themselves. Secondly, update `GITHUB_SOURCE` and `SCRIPT_RELEASE` in `install.sh`. Finally, you can now push a commit with the message `Release vX.Y.Z` and create a release on GitHub.
